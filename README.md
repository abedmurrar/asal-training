### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository is for exploring javascript without sincerely going deep in it but making the most of the important of it

### What Did I Do here? ###
* Mainly Explored JavaScript ES6
* Started with node.js
#### in the no bootstrap folder ####
* Explored functions, objects and variables
* Explored Closures
* In addition to more conventional HTML forms and validation

#### in the ajax folders ####
* More styling techniques for forms
* Git branching, push and pull, and other commands
* Dealing with HTTP GET and POST requests with Ajax and jQuery with different forms of data such as XML, JSON, and text files
* Learnt more in HTTP request/response headers and more security headers from the server
* connect the script to apache2 Server with PHP scripts to get/write data to MySQL Server

### How can it benefit anyone? ###
* The jQuery and the HTML Form is written to be embedded simply in any HTML code
* Data sent with post/get can simply be modified to any data required to connect to any database/server

### How can it be made better? ###
* Turn whole HTML Form into a grid system to make it more responsive without media queries
* embed the javascript scripts in the end of the HTML pages
* add more security to the HTTP requests
